Small App Assignment: Contact Search Tool

Build a small web application that allows users to search for contacts by name or phone number.

Create a simple HTML page with an input field and a submit button.
- Implement a function to handle the submit event.
- Determine if the input is a string (name) or a number (phone number).
- Based on the input type, search the contacts array:
- If it's a string, filter contacts whose first or last name contains the string. Consider case sensitivity.
- If it's a number, find contacts whose phone number matches.

Display the matching contacts below the input field. You can list their names and phone numbers as a simple unordered list in HTML. Add styling to improve the layout.
